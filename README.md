###by Jeff Taylor-Chang

	In the year 7438 a mass extinction of the human race occurred. The humans hunger for expansion sped up its inevitable
	 destruction. In 2080, the usable space for development has diminished causing a race for the creation of new land. In the
	 process, and by mistake, a new and alternate dimension was formed. The problem was that the dimension could not be controlled
	 and started to wreak havoc. To prevent the further devastation of the world population, a new type of soldier was created.
	 These were the Breach Troopers. They didn't use weapons to attempt to solve the conflicts between the two dimensions, and
	 instead they posed the ability to open rifts in space and time to travel between both. They were also capable of manipulating
	 their environment. The Breach Troopers were successfully preventing destruction between dimensions until the troopers caused
	 the entire world to travel through a gigantic rift, to the year 2079 in order to stop people from creating the dimension.
	 Only, they made a mistake and they sent the world hurtling to the year 7438. One Breach Trooper refused to participate and
	 created a rift and travelled into the alternate dimension. When the whole world passed through the rift, all genetically
	 advanced organisms on earth were annihilated by the creatures of the alternate world, a mirror of the regular. Only the
	 world structures survived but were severely damaged by the pull through the rift. The only human that remained was the one
	 trooper that was in the alternate dimension. Once he travelled back to his world, he found the destruction. In order to claim
	 retribution for the atrocities of world extinction, he set out to destroy the alternate dimension and restore the universe to
	 its natural balance. He must save humanity and save the world.

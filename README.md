Genesis Rift
====

##Story - by Jeff Taylor-Chang

In the year 7438 a mass extinction of the human race occurred. The humans hunger for expansion sped up its inevitable
 destruction. In 2080, the usable space for development had diminished causing a race for the creation of new land. In the
 process, and by mistake, new parallel dimensions were discovered.
 
The development on dimension travel progressed at an incredible pace as the nations of the world scrambled to see which would be the
 first to provide dimension travel technology to its citizens. Unfortunately, this breakneck pace of innovation resulted
 in multiple sizeable lab accidents across the globe. Despite these accidents, development continued for the potential
 benefits the technology could have on mankind.

At first, a select few received prototype devices to test which connected to the users back. They found countless uses, from fitting more things
 in their basements to cutting through rush hour traffic. Eventually, the manufacturers were able to develop technology. They slowly changed it from
 a plug-in-to-the-wall to charge device that was large and bulky. After some time they developed a smaller apparatus that was the beginnings of a hand module.
 It was connected to the entire forearm and could charge using solar energy. Then they managed to produce a version that was connected to the hands only like
 a glove but could only open a miniature rift. Then they produced a version that used nuclear fission to produce massive amounts of energy.
 Strangely, many testers reported that their device had mysteriously disappeared, only to receive angry replies from the labs from which
 they had loaned the devices. It was no big deal, right? What's the worst that could happen with such a device, anyway?

In the months that followed, utter pandemonium broke out around the world. Bank managers would unlock protected
 company safes to discover that all the money would be gone and that the security cameras showed that nothing happened.
 Parents would wake up and realize their child had completely vanished from their homes. Figures of authority would
 mysteriously disappear from their offices, leaving no one in charge. The entire world broke down into shock and fear.

However, all was not lost.

The problem was that these dimensions could not be controlled and started to wreak havoc. To prevent the further devastation of the world population, a new type of soldier was created.
 These were the Guardians. They didn't use weapons to attempt to solve the conflicts between dimensions
 instead they possessed the ability to open rifts in space and time to travel between them. They were also capable of manipulating
 their environment. The Guardians used the same device as the civilian prototype users had but they were integrated into their special armour and released energy through their hands instead.
 Also, instead of having the energy storage be built onto their back, it was encased in grooves coursing through the armour.
 The Guardians were successful in preventing destruction between dimensions until they decided to open
 a huge rift to let mass colonization of the alternate dimensions to take place. 
 However, they made a mistake and they sent the world hurtling to the year 7438. One Guardian refused to participate in
 creating the rift and travelled into an alternate dimension. When the whole world passed through the rift, all genetically
 advanced organisms on earth were annihilated by the creatures of the alternate world, a mirror of the regular. Only the
 world structures survived but were severely damaged by the pull through the rift. The only human that remained was the one
 trooper that was in the third dimension. Once he travelled back to his world, he found the destruction. In order to claim
 retribution for the atrocities of world extinction, he set out to destroy the extra dimensions and restore the universe to
 its natural balance. He must save humanity and save the world.

##Game Structure

The game structure is sorted chronologically with START being the first and END being the last.

OBJ + number = objective (1 (first), 2 (second), etc.)

CHK + number = checkpoint (1 (first), 2 (second), etc.)

Rooms/locations are dynamically loaded. While you are solving one location, the next will load.
Saving occurs instantaneously, automatically, and constantly. There is no need to enter a menu / reach a checkpoint.

START

You wake up in a nodescript white room. You do not know who you are or how you got there. Voices over the speaker
 (or some other method) inform you that you are in a training course to become a new type of soldier. At first, they
 hand you a glasses-like device, called Dimension Vision. This prototype device allows the viewer to perceive objects in other
 dimensions. You are also introduced to the rift, an opening in space between two dimensions. Also, you are given
 a device capable of manipulating the environment via pushing and pulling. Your cognitive abilities
 are put to the test by rooms designed to familiarize and push the limits of what you know. The test supervisors
 remind you that they will eventually give you a dimension crystal that allows you to change dimensions on your own.

Midway through the test, an enormous explosion shakes the facility. You happen to be in an elevator, which unhinges and rapidly
 undergoes free-fall. However, being a glass elevator, you can see the layers of the facility pass by as you descend deeper
 into the void of the earth. There is a large chunk of the earth missing. You are suprised that you haven't died, and that is because
 was a beam of energy that stops the elevator.
 
Intrigued, you exit the elevator and examine your surroundings. You appear to be standing in a wrecked laboratory.
 The beam of light that stopped the elevator shines out of a grate in the ground. Its source comes from deep inside
 the structure, but a shattered prism reflects it to intercept the elevator's path. From markings on the wall, this
 is a top secret lab, hidden deep underground. The entrance to the lab has been crushed by shards of the earth that have fallen.
 Inside the lab, there are test chambers that test a prototype portable dimension travel device, which had been in development
 before the world fell apart. From the broken device, the dimension crystal that tuned it is on the ground.
 Utilizing this crystal, you try to navigate the somewhat-intact rooms of the lab to escape back to the surface. However,
 the chilling fact that no one is in the facility remains in your head before you discover that you are not alone.
 
The reason why the lab was put underground, you discover, was that it had been invaded by monsters from another dimension.
 The elevator shaft had been cut off to prevent these monsters from propagating upwards. Everywhere, remnants of those
 who failed to exit the facility before it was sunk. The reason the lab was made, you discover, was to probe different
 dimensions and what existed in each.

The word "Genesis" is in large letters with a slash that cuts off the corner of the word to signify
 that it is passing through something. The word "Rift" is also passing through the same slash but is offset
 down on the x and y.

The main character is standing in the black dimension and light is being emitted from his suit which
 is glowing with energy. He has his back to the camera and a large shadow of a monster is visible.
 The main character is looking back over his shoulder and purple light is coming out of his eye sections.

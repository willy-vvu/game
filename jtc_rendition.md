##About

The game is free and open source but to get expansion packs, you must donate money which goes to a charity
 that will be started by the creators of Genesis Rift mainly Jeff Taylor-Chang and Brian Zhao. Also any
 extra donations also go to the same charity. Every penny of profit produced by Genesis Rift donations
 will be dedicated to the charity.

##The Charity - Computed Significance

The charity is called Computed Significance and provides the funds required to supply inner city students with computers and other resources
 to learn because we recognized the importance of computers and how they impact the ability for a student to learn. We also
 recognize how computers helped us achieve our goals and learn better.

##Story - by Jeff Taylor-Chang

Over the many years that humanity existed, they had plenty of time to come up with conspiracy theories about who, what, and how
 humanity would cease to exist. One could say that you can plan for the expected and probably will. One could also say that you
 could try to plan for the concieved. With all that planning and conceiving, it is quite easy to forget about the major fact that
 you can't predict what you cannot perceive. It was not global warming that killed the humans. It was not disease that killed the
 humans either. It was also not famine, nor war. All those predictions about the human era coming to a close were wrong. No one
 would have guessed the exact cause of extinction but what was predicted was that ultimatley, the humans love for expansion and
 development, greed, would cause the end of human reign. The question is, how?

The year 2060, a "psychopath" by the name of Renlar was arrested on the streets of Boston for "spreading terror." Still the media
 had a field day with broadcasting his cynical premonitions. They involved the end of the world. Although he did not predict exactly
 how, he was a key stepping stone in the start of the end of the world.

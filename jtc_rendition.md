##About

The game is free and open source but to get expansion packs, you must donate money which goes to a charity
 that will be started by the creators of Genesis Rift mainly Jeff Taylor-Chang and Brian Zhao. Also any
 extra donations also go to the same charity. Every penny of profit produced by Genesis Rift donations
 will be dedicated to the charity.

##The Charity - Computed Significance

The charity is called Computed Significance and provides the funds required to supply inner city students with computers and other resources
 to learn because we recognized the importance of computers and how they impact the ability for a student to learn. We also
 recognize how computers helped us achieve our goals and learn better.

##Story - by Jeff Taylor-Chang

Over the many years that humanity existed, they had plenty of time to come up with conspiracy theories about who, what, and how
 humanity would cease to exist. One could say that you can plan for the expected and probably will. One could also say that you
 could try to plan for the concieved. With all that planning and conceiving, it is quite easy to forget about the major fact that
 you can't predict what you cannot perceive. It was not global warming that killed the humans. It was not disease that killed the
 humans either. It was also not famine, nor war. All those predictions about the human era coming to a close were wrong. No one
 would have guessed the exact cause of extinction but what was predicted was that ultimatley, the humans love for expansion and
 development, greed, would cause the end of human reign. The question is, how?

The year 2060, a "psychopath" by the name of Renlar was arrested on the streets of Boston for "spreading terror." Still the media
 had a field day with broadcasting his cynical premonitions. They involved the end of the world. Although he did not predict exactly
 how, he was a key stepping stone in the start of the end of the world.

Sometimes, people have these very vivid dreams. Renlar woke up one day in cold sweat and had the horrifying truth of what would
 happen scarred into his memory. He saw the end of the world. Most people would call his dream a nightmare or a good reason to
 hire a psychologist. Renlar believed in what he saw and since he had no living relations to warn, he ran onto the streets of
 Boston right into a crime scene. He started waving his arms and yelling about how the world was going to end and so the news
 crew decided to film it. The video made instant success as it was watched by many. He then continued his crusade by atending
 interviews on tv to talk about what happened. Renlar got headlines on almost every single newspaper that existed. Then a few
 years later, 2060, he was walking down his driveway to get his mail when two people in suits walked up on both sides of him and
 grabbed him by the arms. He found himself ushered into a large black van and drove to the police station. The government had
 arrested Renlar for what they called "a verble form of terrorism." Renlar was never seen again.

The suggestions that Renlar had made to avoid the end of the world was ignored as would be expected. He asked for people
 to stop something that they hadn't even done yet. He told them not to make another dimension. He also had asked people
 to start thinking about how to develop more without doing so. As there was still plenty of land left to develop on, no
 one paid any heed to Renlar's suggestions. It is too bad though. They could have saved humanity.

The years leading up to 2080 were considered the golden ages for development. Skyscrapers were being built taller than ever before,
 gigantic biodomes were being built to support plant growth in the deserts. Almost every single forest became a city. By the year
 2079, the USA could have been considered one gigantic city as there wasn't even a boundary between cities and they all connected.
 People still wanted to continue building and expanding even though, in the back of their minds, they realized that it couldn't be
 sustained. Thus they planned and decided that by reversing the equation for energy, they could create matter. The nations of the
 world worked together for the first time to route all of their power from nuclear reactors, solar plants, hydroelectric dams, to
 a matter generator that expelled a plethora of material into space with a mass higher than the Earth's. The large mass in space
 was entirely in an unknown element which reacted with the high amounts of energy radiated from the plasma from the sun. A center
 core developed with the rest swirling around it because of its gravitational fields. The people on Earth looked up into the sky
 and saw a gigantic rift in space and saw a second planet inside. A dark planet. Then almost as fast as it appeared, it vanished
 as the rift collapsed on itself. The designers of the generator were dissappointed by what they saw as a failure of their design.
 It hadn't produced a mass of land that was suspended in space in a set distance from the Earth that could be used to build on, but
 instead had produced a gigantic rift. Although their generator didn't produce what they had wanted, it was an amazing discovery in
 the manipulation of space and time. One that wouldn't be realized until it was nearly too late.

No one was fooled by the Governments speeches about the other world that were intended to quell the fear that was developing in the
 minds of the masses. Thus, many became even more frightened by the fact that the Governments refused to recognize the percieved threat
 of another world. This caused multiple mass suicides of radical groups of people that had been believed to have been eradicated in the
 golden years. The facade created by the Government about the absolute lack of biological organisms on the dark planet was demolished
 nearly over-night by a newly founded company by the name of Genesis Corp. Genesis Corp had been trying to understand the rift in space
 and had finally, after 5 years of research, had figured out how to replicate the rift on the small scale and sustain it. Then in the
 year 2086, the corporation launched a small armies worth of unmanned search drones through the rift. What they found was horrifying.
 They began to realize that the other planet was a parralel planet in which intelligent organisms had taken hold. They were terrible
 monsters that ruled the darkness. Upon entering the rift, the drones were mostly destroyed. Only one managed to make it back through
 the rift. That would have been something of a relief for the scientists except for what followed it. The corporation had a celebration
 for their achievements and revealed to the world what lay on the other side of rifts.

Within days of the returning of the last drone, people around the facility started to disappear. Bodies would be found with their neck's
 torn and there would be bloody handprints on windows as if someone was trying to escape. The building security was having a nightmare.
 They found security cameras smashed and electrical conduits ripped out. Something was trying to destroy Genesis Corp and no one knew a
 shred of information about it. The knowledge of the events were withheld from the public. People naturally assumed that the company was
 working on some top secret project, and because of the previous accomplishments, they let them be. Within weeks, all video feed from
 the buildings security network was down. Genesis Corp was afraid of what was happening and in a last ditch effort, an engineer drew out
 blueprints to what he believed was the solution. On the day of his death, he came into his office and started drafting out the design
 for a special type of soldier he called "Guardians." While he was just about to sign the blueprints, the door opened behind him.
 He was so immersed in his work that he didn't even hear it. Based on the webcam built into his laptop, the events were as so. The engineer
 could be seen at his desk quickly sketching something when the door opened, only nothing was there. Then papers started to move slightly as
 if there was an air current in the room. Then suddenly, the engineer was flung backwards into the wall where he collapsed to the floor still
 clutching his pen. Then the door slowly closed. After a few minutes, the engineer's eyes fluttered open and he slowly crawled to his drawing.
 He pulled himself up to his desk and had the time to write "our last hope" on the blueprints before dropping his pen and falling back to the
 ground. He never got up again and the security team found him in his office a few hours later.

The head of Genesis Rift liked the idea of the Guardians and immediatly assigned a team to produce the armor. He then hand selected a team
 of 20 to be the Guardians. All the selected Guardians were put through intense training and hours logged for learning how to use their suits
 to the maximum affectiveness. As soon as the Guardian's were done being trained, they were sent on their first mission. Find and destroy that
 which was lurking in Genesis Corp, at all costs.

Thus starts the story of Guardian 1's fight for survival and the saving of mankind

##Trailer 1

The earth is shown from space and it shows timelapsed development. The insane pase at which human growth expanded is shown and there is a time
 stamp in the corner. Once it gets to the year 2060 from 2020 it shows Renlar's story. Then it continues until 2079 when the rift was made.
 It shows the rift. Then it shows the Genesis Corp problem with views from security cameras and then the webcam of the engineer. Then the head
 of Genesis Corp at a table with the blueprints telling people what to do. Then it shows robotic arms building the suits. Then the suit is finished
 and the camera starts to fly around like the crysis suit video. Then when it gets to the helmet, it shows the front and suddenly the lights in the
 eye pieces glow on and the title is shown. Then it acts like the screen shutdown and says the day it is coming out and that all profits go to charity

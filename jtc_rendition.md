##Story - by Jeff Taylor-Chang

Over the many years that humanity existed, they had plenty of time to come up with conspiracy theories about who, what, and how
 humanity would cease to exist. One could say that you can plan for the expected and probably will. One could also say that you
 could try to plan for the concieved. With all that planning and conceiving, it is quite easy to forget about the major fact that
 you can't predict what you cannot perceive. It was not global warming that killed the humans. It was not disease that killed the
 humans either. It was also not famine, nor war. All those predictions about the human era coming to a close were wrong. No one
 would have guessed the exact cause of extinction but what was predicted was that ultimatley, the humans love for expansion and
 development, greed, would cause the end of human reign. The question is, how?
